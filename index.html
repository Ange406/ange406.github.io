			<p id="coolfact">Accomplishment I'm most proud of: For the first year of my daughter's life, I ate only a total variety of 6
			foods: Chicken, Avocado, Bananas, Coconut, Sweet Potato, Carrots. (Salt and 
			Pepper were my only seasoning options.) Millie, my daughter, had extremely
			terrible allergies and would react through me.  But I did it, and she's 
			outgrown them, and I'm really pumped to have sushi back in my life!  It was the
			hardest mental thing I've ever done, but worth every damn piece of chicken.
