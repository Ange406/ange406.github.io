        <h3>Profile</h3>
            <p>Aspiring Full-stack Web Developer. <br>
            For the first year of my daughter's life, I ate only a total variety of 6
            foods: Chicken, Avocado, Bananas, Coconut, Sweet Potato, Carrots. (Salt and 
            Pepper were my only seasoning options. She had extremely
            terrible allergies and would react through breastmilk.  But I did it, and she's 
            outgrown them, and I'm really pumped to have sushi back in my life!  It was 
            hardest mental thing I've ever done, but worth every damn piece of chicken.
